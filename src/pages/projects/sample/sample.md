# This is a heading
Hello this is the heading of some text which is super fun and not annoying to type at all

## This is a subheading
Yet another subject which we will use **bold** text and then an unordered list:
- first
- second
- third

## Another subheading 
This section has some cool stuff.

For example it has an code sample and a horizantal or however you spell it rule.

`for( int i = 0; i< 10; i++)`
`{ printf("hello world\n");}`

Here is another code sample:
```
/* This is a text comment
   which is a couple of lines */
printf("hello there\n");
```

# A second major heading
In this cool section I am going to put an image
