  Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags below.
  It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
  Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
    
  Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
  work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
  Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      Define the visual representation of the website an iOS device will use when
      accessed by the homescreen. If this is not defined then the user will see a
      minified version of the website which won't be very pleasant to look at.
      Icons should be 180x180 and let the device scale them down to meet the particular
      need.
